Can we solve a problem of poor posture using webcamera and pose tracking?
==========================================================================
Fix Posture is an experimental project where A.I. tracks posture and blurs the screen if a person is sitting poorly.

Made with TensorFlow.js PoseNet model, ml5.js and p5.js.

* posenet.js is a part with A.I.
* script.js is a file with UI tricks

Made by me (be monolesan!!!)
